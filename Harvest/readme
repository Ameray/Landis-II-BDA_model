# LANDIS-II Biomass Harvest Prescriptions

This repository provides a full implementation of **Biomass Harvest** prescriptions for use with the LANDIS-II model. The strategy includes both **even-aged** and **uneven-aged silvicultural systems**, targeting species based on **shade tolerance**, **maturity age**, **longevity**, and **ecological role** in boreal and mixedwood forests.

---

## 🌲 Objectives

These prescriptions aim to:

- Simulate realistic forest management aligned with ecological forestry principles.
- Reflect current provincial practices such as CPRS, seed-tree retention, commercial thinning, and shelterwood systems.
- Target species and stand ages based on silvics and economic importance.

## 🧬 Species and Age Logic

Each treatment targets species based on their **shade tolerance**, **regeneration strategy**, and **economic importance**:
